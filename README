I write a lot of things in dokuwiki format, so it would be really nice to have a parser of mine.

 - in site link and out of site link
 - basic text effect(bold, etc.)
 - footnote(double parenthesizes)
 - sectioning(= indicates section, 4 dashes or more means a horizontal line.)
 - media files
 - List(2 space indentation, then * or - to represent unordered and ordered list.)
 - nowiki tag
 - code and file tag
 - html tag(HTML stands for block level elements)

states: normal, html, code, file, nowiki

normal: reading a line, check if it's list or section, if not, it's just normal text, then proceed, but check
        things like media, text formatting, link and footnote.


- table is not supported now, but is on roadmap.
- quote is not supported now, but is on roadmap.
- namespaced internal links is not in the plan.
- php tag is not in the plan.
- Text Conversions is not in the plan.
